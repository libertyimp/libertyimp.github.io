		<description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed I have completly switched up the look on my website for what I think is the better(hopefully you agree lol) I will do my best to keep things mostly up to date and will keep the blogs rolling again, its been awhile since i have made a blog post and so i hope to get back into it again. I will be speaking on things of intrest such as games, computer stuff, politics, general thoughts/opinions and other stuff as well so keep an eye out :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Thanks for reading :)**&lt;/p&gt;
